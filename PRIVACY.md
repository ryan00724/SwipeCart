# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 05, 2025

SwipeCart ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by SwipeCart.

## 1. Information We Collect

**1.1 Locally Stored Data**
The majority of the data you generate (shopping lists, pantry items, preferences) is stored locally on your device using on-device storage technologies. We do not maintain a central server that stores your personal shopping lists.

**1.2 Third-Party Services**
We use the following third-party services which may collect information to function:
*   **Google Image Search API:** Used to fetch product images. Search queries (product names) are sent to Google to retrieve images.
*   **Open Food Facts:** Used to retrieve nutritional information. Product names/barcodes are sent to their database.
*   **Apple Services:** Used for processing payments (In-App Purchases) and cloud backups (if iCloud backup is enabled on your device).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information strictly to:
*   Provide and maintain the Service.
*   Process your lifetime subscription purchase.
*   Generate AI-powered food recommendations.
*   Display product images and nutritional details.

## 3. Data Retention

Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. Deleting the application will remove the locally stored data associated with the app, unless it has been backed up by your device's system (e.g., iCloud Backup).

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
