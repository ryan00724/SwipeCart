# Terms and Conditions

**Last updated:** December 05, 2025

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the SwipeCart mobile application (the "Service") operated by Ryan Creary ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

## 1. Purchases and Lifetime Access

**1.1 Lifetime Subscription**
The Service may offer a "Lifetime Subscription" or "Lifetime Access" purchase option. This is a one-time payment that grants you access to premium features for the lifetime of the Service.
*   "Lifetime" refers to the lifetime of the app's availability on the App Store, not the user's life.
*   This purchase is non-consumable and is tied to your Apple ID.

**1.2 Payments**
All payments are processed securely through Apple's In-App Purchase system. We do not store or process your credit card information directly.

**1.3 Refunds**
Refund requests for purchases are handled directly by Apple according to their refund policy. We are unable to issue refunds directly.

## 2. Content and AI Features

**2.1 AI Recommendations**
Our Service uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide food and meal recommendations. These suggestions are generated automatically and should be used for informational purposes only. We do not guarantee the accuracy, suitability, or safety of these recommendations for your specific dietary needs or allergies.

**2.2 Nutritional Information**
Nutritional data (macros, calories) is provided by third-party sources (such as Open Food Facts) or estimated by AI. This data is for reference only and should not be considered medical advice. Always verify crucial dietary information on product packaging.

## 3. User Data

The Service primarily stores your data (shopping lists, basket items) locally on your device. You are responsible for backing up your device to prevent data loss.

## 4. Termination

We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Ryan Creary, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service.

## 6. Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
