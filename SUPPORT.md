## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. How do I restore my Lifetime Purchase?
If you have purchased the Lifetime Access but don't see premium features active (or if you reinstalled the app), go to the **Profile/Settings** screen and tap the **"Restore Purchases"** button. Ensure you are signed into the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.

### 2. How does the Swipe feature work?
*   **Swipe Right:** Keep the item (Adds/Keeps it in your Shopping List).
*   **Swipe Left:** Discard the item (Removes it from your current view).

### 3. My product images aren't loading.
The app uses an internet connection to fetch product images for the first time. Please ensure you have an active internet connection. Once fetched, images are cached for faster loading.

### 4. How do I clear my list?
You can clear your basket or shopping list by tapping the "Clear" or "Reset" button found in the top-right corner or bottom of the list screen.

### 5. Is my data backed up?
Your data lives on your device. If you have iCloud Backup enabled for your iPhone, your app data should automatically be included in your device backups.
